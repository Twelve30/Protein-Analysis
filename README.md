# Protein-Analysis
A simple program that takes the amino acid sequence a protein and returns the number of particular residues in said protien

This is a simple program made in C# that analyses the amino acid sequence in a protein and returns the number of particular residues in the sequence. It can also be used on any string to checkk how many times a particular character occurs in it.

Can take upto ~4000 character long strings as input. Protein sequences can be taken from UniProt. Just download the FASTA file, open it in a text editor, copy the amino acid sequence and paste it into the program. Then, enter all the amino acids that you want to count in a single string. The program will output the result as number and percentage of residues. The program can only do single character amino acid code
